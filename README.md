## The Teleport App

The Teleport app allows you to take photos via your Webcam and quickly remove the background from these photos and replace them with images of your choosing. You can click and drag the resulting outline of your webcam photo, resize it, and add to the final image if you wish, which all combine to allow you to create composite images for whatever purposes you may have: whether you'd like to generate your own meme image, or just take a pic and pretend to be someplace else, the Teleport app is a fun, quick way to get you there.

## How to Use

1. Click 'Take Picture' to take a pic using your computer's webcam. You can choose to either save this pic or retake it.

2. If you choose 'Save Picture', the background of your image is removed and you're presented with an image cutout of yourself which you can click and drag. Click on it once to open up the transform controls. Click and drag on any of the white squares that appear to change the image size or rotate it, etc. Click on the image once more to remove the transform controls.

3. On the bottom of the screen is a list of backgrounds. You can scroll through this list and click on any of the images there to select a background image to be placed behind your image cutout. You can add your own background image by entering the URL for the image of your choice where it say 'Add New Backgroud' and clicking 'Save'.

4. You can add text, if you wish, by click on the drop-down menu that says 'Select Background Image' and selecting 'Add Text to Image' instead. Here, you can choose what your text will say by filling in the 'Content' field, pick the text size, the font, and the color of the text.

5. Once you're satisfied with your image, click "Save Final Image". At this point, this picture will be saved to your list of final images. You can view your final image list by moving your mouse cursor to the right side of the screen. A drawer will open where you can view your previously-created images. Click any of them to view them in full screen. Click the X button to close the image when you're done.
